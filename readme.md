# Terraform Activity

This activity shows how to launch an instance using Terraform. In the main.tf file, I created a variable for my public subnet b within my VPC and a variable for my security group. Then I configure my cloud provider (AWS) with my credentials to log in to my account. After that, I create a resource block that specifies what AWS resource I want to create. For this, I create a T2.micro instance with an Ubuntu AMI, a security group referred to in the variable, a subnet referred to in the variable, the name of the instance, and my user data. In my user data (deploy.sh), it downloads everything involving Jenkins into my instance. After that, it will output the IP of the new instance it created.
